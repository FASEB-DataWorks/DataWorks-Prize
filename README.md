The DataWorks! Prize recognizes excellence, amplifies best practices, and rewards teams for integrating data sharing and reuse into their research processes.  By showcasing excellence and augmenting incentives with a substantial prize, FASEB will create deep community engagement around  data sharing and reuse practices - in research process, training, and promotion processes. 

# Promoting a culture of data sharing and reuse

The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are championing a bold vision of data sharing and reuse. The DataWorks! Prize fuels this vision with an annual challenge that showcases the benefits of research data management while recognizing and rewarding teams whose research demonstrates the power of data sharing or reuse practices to advance scientific discovery and human health. We are seeking new and innovative approaches to data sharing and reuse in the fields of biological and biomedical research. 

To incentivize effective practices and increase community engagement around data sharing and reuse, the 2022 DataWorks! Prize will distribute up to 12 monetary team awards. Submissions will undergo a two-stage review process, with final awards selected by a judging panel of NIH officials. 

*Eligibility:* Research groups in biomedical and biological sciences are invited to self-nominate. Nominations and application review criteria will support FASEBâ€™s diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion goals.  

*Service Commitment:*  Awardees will be expected to deliver a presentation that showcases their data sharing and/or reuse practices and research outcomes, to publish a paper detailing their data practices, and to serve as a practice ambassador in their research community. 

# Submit your application or nomination today
[[Share your story](https://www.herox.com/dataworks)] of how you reused or shared data to further your biological and/or biomedical research effort. 

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding to support the Community and Prize programs.
