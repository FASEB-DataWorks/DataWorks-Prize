The DataWorks! Prize recognizes biological and biomedical research teams who integrate data sharing and reuse to advance human health.

FASEB seeks to catalyze community action by articulating an audacious vision of data reuse.  The DataWorks! Prize fuels this vision with a US $1 million recognition and rewards program directed at the data reuse ecosystem: research teams with exemplary data sharing practices and research teams that reuse data from multiple sources to support innovative research aligned with FASEB’s mission of advancing health and well-being.

# Promoting a culture of data sharing and reuse

The DataWorks! Catalyst Prize recognizes excellence, amplifies best practices, and rewards teams for integrating data sharing and reuse into their research processes.  By showcasing excellence and augmenting incentives with a substantial prize, FASEB will create deep community engagement around  data sharing and reuse practices - in research process, training, and promotion processes. 

*Eligibility:* Research groups in biomedical and biological sciences are invited to self-nominate. Groups must have at least one person affiliated with a FASEB member society. Nominations and application review criteria will support FASEB’s diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion goals.  

*Time Commitment:*  Awardees will be expected to deliver a presentation that showcases their data sharing and/or re-use practices and research outcomes, to publish a paper detailing their data practices, and to serve as a practice ambassador in their research community. 

*Capacity:*  1-3 awards per annual prize cycle. The DataWorks! Catalyst Prize will be offered in partnership with aligned organizations, agencies, and corporate sponsors.

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyst Prize.
